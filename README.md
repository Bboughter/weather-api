# weather-api

## Description

This page was created so that a user can search a city for the current weather as well as the weather for the next 5 days. It was accomplished by using mostly HTML and JavaScript to fetch data from a weather API in order to display the information. Minimal CSS was used.

## Installation

No installation required. This page can be accessed at https://bboughter.github.io/weather-api/.

## Usage

The user will be presented with a blank page and a search box. The user will need to enter in a city and click the search button. When this is done, the current forecast and the five day forecast will appear on the page. The weather will include an image of the weather, date, temperature, wind speed, and humidity. As soon as a user searches, the city is appended on the page under the search button and the user can go back to that cities weather because the search was made into a button.
